# About this course

This is the Advance-Macroeconomics course I took while I was studying at Kobe University as an exchange student from October, 2019.
I learned how to do macroeconomics empirical modelling analysis by actual macroeconomics variables using statistical programming software, R. Including the method of extracting trend & cyclical component of real GDP data in order to observe the business cycle, the ability to replicate previous studies, both Kaynasian and Classical models, by using VAR(Vector autoregression) model with recent data.
